About
Opened in 1924, the Purdue Memorial Union was created out of the need for a location that Purdue students, faculty, and visitors could gather in. Funding was raised by the Class of 1912 and was ongoing until the start of World War I. It was decided after the start of the war that the building would become a memorial to all the men and women from Purdue who fought and died during the conflict. The PMU was opened in 1924, but not completely finished until 1929.
