About
The France A. Córdova Recreational Sports Center (CoRec) originally opened in 1957 and was the first university building in the United States created for the sole purpose of servicing students' recreational sports needs. The building is named after the university's 11th president, who served from 2007 to 2012. The CoRec has received several updates throughout the years with the most recent expansion being completed in 2012.
