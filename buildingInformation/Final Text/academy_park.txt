About
Occupying what used to be a series of streets and parking lots behind the Purdue Memorial Union, Academy Park was modeled after Plato's The Academy. The Academy was a place where ideas were discussed and exchanged and Purdue tried to replicate this atmosphere with Academy Park. The five-acre space offers students plenty of seating areas and on warm days many students and staff take advantage of the grassy hills and trees. Since opening in 1997, Academy Park has been used as an informal classroom, a staging area for live performances, and a forum for student presentations.
