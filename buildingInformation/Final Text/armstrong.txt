About
The Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering was completed in 2007 and houses many of the university's schools of engineering. The building is the flagship of the College of Engineering and represents Purdue's strategic plan to remain at the forefront of engineering research and education. Within the 200,000 square foot building lies a highlight of Purdue Engineering achievements, from Neil Armstrong's spacewalk to the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam. A sample from the Moon is housed within Armstrong Hall and is viewable in the main atrium.
