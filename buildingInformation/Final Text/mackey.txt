About
Mackey Arena was opened in 1967 and is home to Purdue basketball teams and will also occasionally host home games for wrestling and volleyball. The arena was created to replace the Lambert Fieldhouse and was originally called the Purdue Arena before being renamed in 1972 to honor longtime athletic direct Guy "Red" Mackey. Mackey Arena can seat nearly 15,000 individuals and is considered to be one of the loudest arenas in the nation due to the shape of its aluminum roof.
