About
Standing at 160 feet tall, the current Purdue Bell Tower draws inspiration from the old Heavilon Hall Tower, which was demolished in 1956. The current tower was a gift from the class of 1948 and was completed in 1995. At the top of the bell tower lies the original Heavilon Hall Tower bells which ring every half hour. The Purdue Bell Tower also has the capability to play the Purdue Fight Song and the Alma Mater. At the base of the tower lies a time capsule that is to be opened in 2095. An old Purdue legend states that any student who walks over the seal at the base of the tower is cursed and will not graduate in four years.
