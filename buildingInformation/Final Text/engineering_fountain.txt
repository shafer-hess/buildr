About
The Engineering Fountain, also referred to as The Purdue Mall Water Sculpture, was built in 1989 and is located in front of the Hovde Hall of Administration. The Engineering Fountain was made possible thanks to the Purdue graduating class of 1939 celebrating their 50 year anniversary. Costing an estimated $350,000, the Engineering Fountain is 38 feet tall, was created with around 228 tons of concrete, and has a fountain jet capable of outputting 588 gallons of water a minute (which is recycled through the metal grates at the base of the fountain).
