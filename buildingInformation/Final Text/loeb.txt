About
Loeb Fountain, currently located in Purdue's Founders Park, was originally built in front of Hovde Hall in 1959. Funding for the fountain was donated by prominent local residents Bert and June Loeb and the fountain was named after Bert's father, Solomon Loeb. Loeb fountain was retired from its location in front of Hovde Hall in 1988 to prepare for the renovation of Purdue Mall. During the renovation, the Engineering Fountain was erected in its place and Loeb Fountain stayed in storage until 1993 when it was moved to its current Founder's Park location.
