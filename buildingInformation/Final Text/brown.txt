About
In 1967, Purdue University approved the construction of a second chemistry building adjacent to the Wetherill Lab of Chemistry in order to keep up with a growing chemistry department. The building was completed in 1972 but not named after Herbert C. Brown until 1987 to honor Brown's shared winning of the Nobel Prize of Chemistry.
