About
Opening in 1982, the Hicks Undergraduate Library is named after John W. Hicks who served as Purdue president from 1982 to 1983. The design of the library was made to be responsive to student needs, offering different types of study spaces for group and individual work. In 2013 the library was renovated to further fulfill the needs of students on campus. The Hicks Undergraduate Library is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week to students with a Purdue University ID card.
