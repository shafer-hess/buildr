About
Once the Lawson Computer Science Building opened in 2006, the Purdue Computer Science department was able to consolidate from five buildings across campus to only two. The Lawson Computer Science building offers a centralized location for faculty, teaching assistant, and research assistant offices as well as classrooms, instructional labs, research labs, and student activity center. The building is named after H. Richard Lawson and his wife Patricia A. Lawson who donated 4.7 million dollars to help make the building a reality.
