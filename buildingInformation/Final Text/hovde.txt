About
The Hovde Hall of Administration was originally called the Purdue Executive Building before being renamed in honor of former Purdue president, Frederick L. Hovde. Hovde was president during Purdue's greatest growth in enrollment and budget. During Hovde's 25 years as president, he quadrupled the number of students enrolled and increased the university's budget tenfold. Additionally, Hovde also established the schools of industrial engineering, materials engineering, and technology and veterinary medicine. Hovde retired in 1971 as Purdue's longest-serving president.
