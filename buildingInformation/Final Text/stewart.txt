About
Construction of the Purdue Memorial Center was completed in 1958 and was originally a place for students to collaborate in classrooms and activity spaces or visit the University Library. In 1972, the building was renamed to the Stewart Center in honor of University Treasurer R.B. Stewart. Stewart Center is currently used as a dedicated meeting facility and also includes Fowler Theater and Loeb Playhouse theaters for events. In front of the Humanities, Social Science, and Education Library is "The Spirit of the Land Grant College" mural which details the contribution that land-grant colleges have made to American higher education.
