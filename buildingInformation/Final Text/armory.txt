About
The Purdue Armory houses many of the ROTC offices on campus. It was rebuilt and completed in 1918 after a fire destroyed the original building. Historically, the Purdue Armory was where students registered and paid for classes and this practice ran from the late 1920s to 1960s. Currently, the Purdue Armory is primarily used by the ROTC and various clubs around campus.
