About
Ross-Ade Stadium officially opened November 22, 1924, and was built to replace Stuart Field which had been the original host of Purdue Football since 1892. Ross-Ade is named after David E. Ross and George Ade, who were the primary funders of the project. The original Ross-Ade stadium had a seating capacity of 13,500 before it was renovated in 2001 for 70  million dollars. After the renovations, the capacity was increased to 62,500.
