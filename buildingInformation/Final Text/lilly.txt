About
The construction of the Lilly Hall of Life Sciences building took around ten years to fully complete. During the planning of the building, Head of Agronomy J.B. Peterson thought that the building was going to be too small and worked to increase the space of the final building by around 50%. The first, second, and third floors of the building's west wing were constructed first in 1951 under the original contract and the remainder of the building was completed thanks to funds provided by Eli Lilly and Company. The east wing and main entrance were completed later, in 1959.
