About
The Wetherill Hall of Chemistry was constructed in two phases. The initial construction began in 1928 and the building was expanded in 1955 to accommodate a rapidly growing department. Purdue's campus evolved and grew faster than any of the architects could have imagined in 1928. The building was named after local physician and lecturer Dr. Richard Benbridge Wetherill and has the names of famous scientists engraved around the perimeter of the building's facade.
